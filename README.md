# Square Connect API Examples

**IMPORTANT:** On 16 February 2016, changes were made to the representation of a
Square merchant in the Connect API. These changes slightly altered the behavior of the
Connect API for applications created after 16 February. The samples in this repository
now reflect this altered behavior. If you created your Connect API application _before_
16 February, samples that reflect your application's behavior are available in the
`v1` directory.

On 23 May 2017, We made a significant improvement to our SDK to expand their
functionality and make them even easier to use. Unfortunately, some of the
changes are not backward compatible.  The samples in this repository now contain
three different folders `v1`, `v2.0`, and `v2.1`.  You can read more about the
new SDK in our [blog post](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/announcing-our-new-versions-of-our-client-sdks-1336d26e8099)

This repository contains simple code samples that demonstrate use of the Square Connect API. Complete documentation for the API is available at [connect.squareup.com](https://connect.squareup.com).

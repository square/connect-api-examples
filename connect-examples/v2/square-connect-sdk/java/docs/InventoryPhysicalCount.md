**referenceId** | **String** | An optional ID provided by the application to tie the [InventoryPhysicalCount](#type-inventoryphysicalcount) to an external system. |  [optional]
**catalogObjectId** | **String** | The Square generated ID of the [CatalogObject](#type-catalogobject) being tracked. |  [optional]
**catalogObjectType** | **String** | The [CatalogObjectType](#type-catalogobjecttype) of the [CatalogObject](#type-catalogobject) being tracked. Tracking is only supported for the &#x60;ITEM_VARIATION&#x60; type. |  [optional]

**quantity** | **String** | The number of items affected by the physical count as a decimal string.

If a Point of Sale app or Dashboard attempts to read a decimal quantity on inventory counts or adjustments, the quantity will be rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, &#x60;2.5&#x60; will become &#x60;2&#x60;, and &#x60;-2.5&#x60; will become &#x60;-3&#x60;.  Read [Decimal Quantities (BETA)](/orders-api/what-it-does#decimal-quantities) for more information. |  [optional]

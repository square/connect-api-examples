See [Embedding the payment form](/payment-form/payment-form-walkthrough) for more information.  __Note:__ Card nonces generated by digital wallets (e.g., Apple Pay) cannot be used to create a customer card. |

**cardholderName** | **String** | The full name printed on the credit card. |  [optional]
**verificationToken** | **String** | An identifying token generated by &#x60;SqPaymentForm.verifyBuyer()&#x60;. Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity. |  [optional]
